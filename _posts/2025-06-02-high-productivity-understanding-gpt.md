**High productivity today! ðŸš€**

I made great progress on my educational AI project by implementing a basic pipeline for tokenization and batching for a mini GPT model in Python. I also organized the code structure and solved import issues between modules â€” now `transformer.py` runs smoothly inside the `model/` folder. I tested the model with a forward pass and got the first loss results!

Every step is a victory toward a deep understanding of Transformers and language models. Excited for the next chapters of this journey!
